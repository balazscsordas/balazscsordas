Hello, I'm Balazs Csordas. I have been working as mechanical engineer, but i realized that i have passion for programming, so since 2022. 08. 25 
i have been learning coding every day after work and in the evenings as well. I am currently focusing on web developement and my goal is to be
really good at it.

i am also interested in work opportunities, you can reach me here: csordasbalu96@gmail.com
